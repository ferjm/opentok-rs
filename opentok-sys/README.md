# Rust FFI bindings for OpenTok Linux SDK

[OpenTok Linux SDK](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/linux/) FFI bindings for Rust.

These bindings are providing *unsafe* FFI API that can be used to interface with OpenTok.

The bindings are autogenerated with [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) with some minor manual changes.

The current generation is driven by the build script. The equivalent bindgen invocation is:

```sh
bindgen libopentok/include/opentok.h -o src/bindings.rs  --whitelist-function 'otc_.*' --whitelist-var 'OTC_.*'
```

The current SDK version is: 2.19.1
